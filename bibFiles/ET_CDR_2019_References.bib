  abstract = {Quantum fluctuation of light limits the sensitivity of advanced laser
	interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. It is one of the principal
	obstacles on the way towards the next-generation gravitational-wave
	observatories. The envisioned significant improvement of the detector
	sensitivity requires using quantum non-demolition measurement and
	back-action evasion techniques, which allow us to circumvent the
	sensitivity limit imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
	In our previous review article (Danilishin and Khalili in Living
	Rev Relativ 15:5, 2012), we laid down the basic principles of quantum
	measurement theory and provided the framework for analysing the quantum
	noise of interferometers. The scope of this paper is to review novel
	techniques for quantum noise suppression proposed in the recent years
	and put them in the same framework. Our delineation of interferometry
	schemes and topologies is intended as an aid in the process of selecting
	the design for the next-generation gravitational-wave observatories.},

  pages = {015003},
  abstract = {Achieving the demanding sensitivity and bandwidth, envisaged for third-generation
	gravitational wave (GW) observatories, is extremely challenging with
	a single broadband interferometer. Very high optical powers (megawatts)
	are required to reduce the quantum noise contribution at high frequencies,
	while the interferometer mirrors have to be cooled to cryogenic temperatures
	in order to reduce thermal noise sources at low frequencies. To resolve
	this potential conflict of cryogenic test masses with high thermal
	load, we present a conceptual design for a 2-band xylophone configuration
	for a third-generation GW observatory, composed of a high-power,
	high-frequency interferometer and a cryogenic low-power, low-frequency
	instrument. Featuring inspiral ranges of 3200 Mpc and 38 000 Mpc
	for binary neutron stars and binary black holes coalesences, respectively,
	we find that the potential sensitivity of xylophone configurations
	can be significantly wider and better than what is possible in a
	single broadband interferometer.},

	Around the globe several observatories are seeking the first direct
	detection of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves are predicted
	by Einstein's general theory of relativity and are generated, for
	example, by black-hole binary systems. Present GW detectors are Michelson-type
	kilometre-scale laser interferometers measuring the distance changes
	between mirrors suspended in vacu um. The sensitivity of these detectors
	at frequencies above several hundred hertz is limited by the vacuum
	(zero-point) fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. A quantum
	technology - the injection of squeezed light - offers a solution
	to this problem. Here we demonstrate the squeezed-light enhancement
	of GEO 600, which will be the GW observatory operated by the LIGO
	Scientific Collaboration in its search for GWs for the next 3-4 years.
	GEO 600 now operates with its best ever sensitivity, which proves
	the usefulness of quantum entanglement and the qualification of squeezed
	light as a key technology for future GW astronomy.},

  abstract = {According to quantum theory the interactions between physical systems
	are quantized. As a direct consequence, measurement sensitivities
	are fundamentally limited by quantization noise, or just `quantum
	noise' in short. Furthermore, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
	demands measurement back-action for some observables of a system
	if they are measured repeatedly. In both respects, squeezed states
	are of high interest since they show a `squeezed' uncertainty, which
	can be used to improve the sensitivity of measurement devices beyond
	the usual quantum noise limits including those impacted by quantum
	back-action noise. Squeezed states of light can be produced with
	nonlinear optics, and a large variety of proof-of-principle experiments
	were performed in past decades. As an actual application, squeezed
	light has now been used for several years to improve the measurement
	sensitivity of GEO600 -- a laser interferometer built for the detection
	of gravitational waves. Given this success, squeezed light is likely
	to significantly contribute to the new field of gravitational-wave
	astronomy. This Review revisits the concept of squeezed states and
	two-mode squeezed states of light, with a focus on experimental observations.
	The distinct properties of squeezed states displayed in quadrature
	phase-space as well as in the photon number representation are described.
	The role of the light's quantum noise in laser interferometers is
	summarized and the actual application of squeezed states in these
	measurement devices is reviewed.},

	requires setting up an additional long baseline, low-loss filter

	in the way each beam propagates in the interferometer, we can engineer
	the input signal beam to have the appropriate frequency-dependent

  abstract = {The Sagnac speed metre topology has been identified as a promising
	technique to reduce quantum back-action in gravitational-wave interferometers.
	However, imbalance of the main beamsplitter has been shown to increase
	the coupling of laser noise to the detection port, thus reducing
	the quantum noise superiority of the speed metre, compared to conventional
	approaches, in particular at low frequencies. In this paper, we show
	that by implementing a balanced homodyne readout scheme with a suitable
	choice of the point from which the local oscillator (LO) is derived,
	the excess laser noise contribution is partly compensated, and the
	resulting speed metre can be more sensitive than state-of-the-art
	position metres. This is achieved by picking-off the LO from either
	the reflection port of the interferometer or the anti-reflective
	coating surface of the main beamsplitter. We show that either approach
	relaxes the relative intensity noise (RIN) requirement of the input
	laser. For example, for a beam splitter imbalance of 0.1% in the
	Glasgow speed metre proof of concept experiment, the RIN requirement
	at frequency of 100 Hz decreases from ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/20/10/103040/njpaae86eieqn1.gif]
	{$4\times {10}^{-10}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$} to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1367-2630/20/10/103040/njpaae86eieqn2.gif]
	{$4\times {10}^{-7}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$} , moving the RIN requirement
	from a value that is hard to achieve in practice, to one which is
	routinely obtained.},

	Abstract = {Strongly squeezed light at telecommunication wavelengths is a necessary resource for one-sided device-independent quantum key distribution via fiber networks. Reducing the optical pump power that is required for its generation will advance this quantum technology towards efficient out-of-laboratory operation. Here, we investigate the second-harmonic pump power requirement for parametric generation of continuous-wave squeezed vacuum states at 1550\&\#x00A0;nm in a state-of-the-art doubly resonant standing-wave periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate cavity setup. We use coarse adjustment of the Gouy phase via the cavity length, together with temperature fine-tuning, for simultaneously achieving double resonance and (quasi) phase matching, and observe a squeeze factor of 13\&\#x00A0;dB at 1550\&\#x00A0;nm from just 12\&\#x00A0;mW of external pump power at 775\&\#x00A0;nm. We anticipate that optimizing the cavity coupler reflectivity will reduce the external pump power to 3\&\#x00A0;mW, without reducing the squeeze factor.},

	Abstract = {We report the experimental realization of squeezed quantum states of light, tailored for new applications in quantum communication and metrology. Squeezed states in a broad Fourier frequency band down to 1 Hz have been observed for the first time. Nonclassical properties of light in such a low frequency band are required for high efficiency quantum information storage in electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) media. The states observed also cover the frequency band of ultra-high precision laser interferometers for gravitational wave detection and can be used to reach the regime of quantum non-demolition interferometry. Furthermore, they cover the frequencies of motion of heavy macroscopic objects and might therefore support attempts to observe entanglement in our macroscopic world.},

	Abstract = {The engineering of strongly squeezed vacuum states of light is a key technology for the reduction of quantum noise in gravitational wave detectors. We report on the observation of up to 12.0 dB squeezed vacuum states of light at the wavelength of 1064 nm in the frequency band from 10 Hz to 100 kHz. This is the strongest squeezing reported to date within this detection band. The squeezed states were generated in a half-monolithic, standing-wave cavity optical parametric amplifier, which was resonant for the fundamental and harmonic light fields. We chose appropriate reflectivities to obtain a significant reduction of the required pump power, which was 8.6 mW only. Our analysis revealed that the residual measurement phase noise was smaller than 3.5 mrad rms and that the squeezed light source provided up to 14 dB of squeezing for a downstream application. The experiment was electronically stabilized in all relevant degrees of freedom, demonstrating the applicability of the linear, doubly resonant cavity topology for current and future gravitational wave detectors.},

	Abstract = {Continuous-wave squeezed states of light at the wavelength of 1550 nm have recently been demonstrated, but so far the obtained factors of noise suppression still lag behind today's best squeezing values demonstrated at 1064 nm. Here we report on the realization of a half-monolithic nonlinear resonator based on periodically-poled potassium titanyl phosphate which enabled the direct detection of up to 12.3 dB of squeezing at 5 MHz. Squeezing was observed down to a frequency of 2 kHz which is well within the detection band of gravitational wave interferometers. Our results suggest that a long-term stable 1550 nm squeezed light source can be realized with strong squeezing covering the entire detection band of a 3rd generation gravitational-wave detector such as the Einstein Telescope.},

This historic achievement was the culmination of a world-wide effort and decades of instrument research. While sufficient for this monumental discovery, the current generation of gravitational-wave detectors represent the least sensitive devices necessary for the task; improved detectors will be required to fully exploit this new window on the Universe. In this paper, we review the application of squeezed vacuum states of light to gravitational-wave detectors as a way to reduce quantum noise, which currently limits their performance in much of the detection band.}

	Abstract = {Quantum noise will be the dominant noise source for the advanced laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors currently under construction. Squeezing-enhanced laser interferometers have been recently demonstrated as a viable technique to reduce quantum noise. We propose two new methods of generating an error signal for matching the longitudinal phase of squeezed vacuum states of light to the phase of the laser interferometer output field. Both provide a superior signal to the one used in previous demonstrations of squeezing applied to a gravitational-wave detector. We demonstrate that the new signals are less sensitive to misalignments and higher order modes, and result in an improved stability of the squeezing level. The new signals also offer the potential of reducing the overall rms phase noise and optical losses, each of which would contribute to achieving a higher level of squeezing. The new error signals are a pivotal development towards realizing the goal of 6 dB and more of squeezing in advanced detectors and beyond.},

	Abstract = {Beam alignment is an important practical aspect of the application of squeezed states of light. Misalignments in the detection of squeezed light result in a reduction of the observable squeezing level. In the case of squeezed vacuum fields that contain only very few photons, special measures must be taken in order to sense and control the alignment of the essentially dark beam. The GEO 600 gravitational wave detector employs a squeezed vacuum source to improve its detection sensitivity beyond the limits set by classical quantum shot noise. Here, we present our design and implementation of an alignment sensing and control scheme that ensures continuous optimal alignment of the squeezed vacuum field at GEO 600 on long time scales in the presence of free-swinging optics. This first demonstration of a squeezed light automatic alignment system will be of particular interest for future long-term applications of squeezed vacuum states of light.},

	Abstract = {The German--British laser-interferometric gravitational wave detector GEO 600 is in its 14th year of operation since its first lock in 2001. After GEO 600 participated in science runs with other first-generation detectors, a program known as GEO-HF began in 2009. The goal was to improve the detector sensitivity at high frequencies, around 1 kHz and above,with technologically advanced yet minimally invasive upgrades. Simultaneously, the detector would record science quality data in between commissioning activities. As of early 2014, all of the planned upgrades have been carried out and sensitivity improvements of up to a factor of four at the high-frequency end of the observation band have been achieved. Besides science data collection, an experimental program is ongoing with the goal to further improve the sensitivity and evaluate future detector technologies. We summarize the results of the GEO-HF program to date and discuss its successes and challenges.},
